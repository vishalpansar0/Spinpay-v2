    <h1>Terms & Conditions:</h1>
<p>Data from the RBI reveals an increase in takers of personal loans in India in the last decade. This can be credited to the fact that it is bothacollateral-
free loan that doesn't risk your assets, and is offered instantly online by lenders who often disburse funds the same or next day.</p>
<p>While personal loan rules and regulations in India are usually governed by the RBI and almost identical amongst lenders, it is important you know the
more detailed loan terms and conditions set by your specific lender before you sign the dotted line. So, keep the following in mind.</p>
<h4>The use of the loan</h4>
<p>The terms and conditions of a personal loan specify that it is versatile and you can use it for any legal purpose. You can use it towards personal needs
like paying your child's school or college fees, renovating your home, or even taking an overseas vacation.</p>
<h4>The eligibility criteria to avail of the loan</h4>
<p>Since a personal loan is unsecured, lenders require you to meet personal loan eligibility criteria. Should you find yourself meeting every criterion listed here.</p>

eligible you must:</p>

    <li>Be employed in an MNC, public or private organisation</li>
</ul>

<h4>The repayment of the loan</h4>
<p>This will tell you the interest rate applicable on your personal loan and how your loan needs to be paid off. While certain sections specify the type of
interest rate and an intimation of charges, other parts may state that your personal loan will need to be repaid in the form of EMIS or in the form of a
lump sum. These conditions vary based on the personal loan you are applying for and the lender you are applying with.</p>
<p>For instance, Spinpay will offers a Flexi personal loan. The terms and conditions for this loan will be different compared to those for a regular personal loan.</p>

personal loans like the Flexi personal loan facility allow you to make part-prepayments and re-withdraw the funds when needed. Here, you can also
find lenders specifying how much of a part-prepayment you can make, so it is best for you to pay close attention. Making part-prepayments ora
foreclosure can often help you become debt-free faster and save money.</p>

charges, statement charges, EMI bounce charges, and more. Thus, it is important you read all the personal loan terms and conditions relating to the
various charges involved, whether you are likely to incur them or not. It is here that you can spot any unnecessary hidden charges and avoid
